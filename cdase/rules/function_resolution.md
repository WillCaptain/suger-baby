# Function Resolution Rule

For each capability implied by a Feature:

- Search existing Function documents by semantics, not names.
- Decide exactly one:
  - Reuse
  - New
  - Version Evolution

Partial semantic mismatch REQUIRES version evolution.

All decisions MUST be logged in Feature documentation.
